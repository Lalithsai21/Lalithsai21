 `An aspiring Data Scientist`
 
I am an ambitious graduate student pursuing a master's degree in Data Science and its Applications at the University at Buffalo. With a GPA of 3.8, I have demonstrated a strong academic background in the field. I have gained practical experience through a one-year internship, where I honed my skills in Python, SQL, data visualization, and machine learning models. Additionally, I worked as a Business Development Associate at BYJU's, which provided me with valuable insights into sales and marketing.
My ultimate goal is to become an accomplished Data Scientist. I possess robust technical skills in Python, SQL, SQLite, as well as data visualization tools such as PowerBI and Tableau. Furthermore, I am proficient in using other tools like Jupyter, VS Code, Git, and Google Colab. As a lifelong learner, I am committed to staying current with the latest trends and advancements in the rapidly evolving field of data science.
